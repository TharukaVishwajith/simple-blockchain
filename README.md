# Simple Blockchain Using Python

## Overview 

This is a simple block-chain using python to demonstrate the basics of a block-chain.

## Dependencies

* hashlib
* datetime

Dependencies can be installed using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). But actually just run this in colab so you don't need to install anything. 

## Usage 

You can download the juypter notebook and run it locally. Also, here is the [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sLAFXSa9S_R2CWLPNrPCJ05Px52FbQeI) link to run it in the browser (recommended).
